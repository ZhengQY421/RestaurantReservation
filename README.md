# Restaurant Reservation
This web app allows diners to reserve spots at a restaurant branch in advance. Customers receive points for successful reservations, which they can redeem for incentives (such as a coupon for a certain restaurant). They can also leave reviews at restaurants.

Restaurant branch owners can also use the web app to manage their restaurant information and reservations.
